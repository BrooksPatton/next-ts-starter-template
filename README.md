## About This Project

### Purpose
This Next.js TypeScript starter template is specifically designed for conducting pair programming interviews.
It provides a robust foundation with common features and challenges that developers encounter in real-world
applications.

### Key Features
- üìù Blog-style content management with CRUD operations
- üîç Server-side and static page generation
- üé® Modern UI components with SCSS styling
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage using Jest and React Testing Library
- üì± Responsive design principles
- üîí Type safety with TypeScript

### Tech Stack
- Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
- TypeScript for type safety
- SCSS modules for styling
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.x or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/next-ts-starter-template.git
cd next-ts-starter-template
```

2. Install dependencies:

- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

### Interview Scenarios
This codebase can be used to evaluate candidates skills in:
- Understanding and extending existing React/Next.js components
- Working with TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implementing new features and fixing bugs
- Writing and maintaining tests
- Handling API integrations and data management
- Applying responsive design principles

### Getting Started for Interviewers
Interviewers can use this template to:
- Add new feature requirements
- Introduce intentional bugs for debugging exercises
- Request improvements to existing components
- Discuss architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Evaluate code quality and best practices
